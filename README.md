## The Problem

Since the events of 7.10, there has been an increase in people experiencing distress  
with no ability to receive immediate assistance, and existing knowledge and services are not accessible to the general public.

### Vulnerable Groups

- Immigrants, new arrivals, or populations with low socio-economic status experience additional difficulty in accessing the information and support they need.
- People with special needs:  
  The challenge directly affects people with special needs, who require tailored responses and suitable support in daily life.
- Diverse Audiences:  
  Anyone can experience such a situation; sometimes the one in need is a caregiver of someone distressed.

## The Current Situation

Since 7.10.23:
- Increase in anxiety victims
- 21% reported moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms
- 38% reported some mental symptom (anxiety/depression/PTSD)
- The Arab sector is at 14% higher risk of experiencing symptoms

## What is the Cost of the Problem in the Current Status?

- 4 billion NIS  
  Estimate of the overall impact of mental health on Israel’s economy
- 1.4 billion NIS  
  Added to the state budget for mental health in 2024

## What is the Expected Impact of the Solution?

- First Aid – Immediate response via a multilingual accessible solution serving most of the country’s residents
- In the long-term – Decrease in the number of anxiety and PTSD victims due to security incidents, life events, and other acute situations
- Economic Stability – Maintaining worker productivity over time

_Citation: Ministry of Health report, “Accessibility of mental health services for people with disabilities,” Dec 2023_

## From Publications

Case studies show that people with special needs have difficulty accessing essential services, leading to social exclusion and inability to cope with stressful situations.

- 7% of public psychologists received training adapted to working with people with disabilities
- 40% of mental health institutions in Israel are not fully accessible in terms of structure, signage, transportation, and pre-coordination
- 60% of respondents with disabilities reported hesitation to seek mental help due to shame, lack of trust in the system, or previous experience of exclusion

_Citation: State Comptroller report (June 2024):_  
Resilience Centers are supposed to serve about 1.3 million emotionally affected people; only 15,750 were treated in these centers by end of 2023 - less than 1.3% of those estimated to be in significant distress.

## Global Model

Scalable for many situations, can contribute globally through accessibility facilitated by government health ministries, HMOs, etc.

### What Can We Contribute or Gain?

- Contribution: Provide support during anxiety events for all populations, even when no one is there to accompany them through the process.
- The gain is a diverse and resilient society.

## MA'ASHE Approach

A proven model for increasing individual resilience during the experience itself:

- **Place** – Connect to physicality, what is accessible in the environment
- **Encouragement for Action** – Physical activity
- **Asking Questions** – Activating cognition
- **Structuring the Event** – Creating memory sequence via performed procedures

### How This Works in Our Project

- **Place** – Connecting to physical presence, accessible surroundings  
  Grounding Activities
- **Encouragement for Action** – Physical activities
- **Asking Questions** – Cognitive stimulation  
  Answering Questions – Anxiety Scale
- **Structuring the Event** – Creating a memory sequence by procedures carried out

## Public Accessibility

- Use without network required
- User adaptation: by age, gender, language, and caregiver status
- Varied scenarios according to user needs
- Use of AI enabling multilingual translation
- Accessibility per WCAG2.2
- Visual impairment:  
  Speech-to-text & text-to-speech
- Hearing impairment:  
  Chat interface  
  Sign language avatar

## Activity Description

- Research:
    - What exists, what’s missing
    - Conversation paths emerging in the process
    - Suitable technologies - matching language models, enabling local AI integration
- Initial development – with AI
    - User experience design via Figma
    - Version management with git
    - Web app development in React Typescript
    - Conversation diagrams via Mermaid
    - Integrating a language model to route conversation, not to provide independent AI responses to users

## What Do We Want to Do Next?

- Basic proof-of-concept for system interfaces:
    - Complete mapping of flowcharts for various case studies
    - Complete user interface including light/dark modes
- New technology development – ability to analyze a situation based on a conversation diagram defined by a mental health professional in Mermaid format
- Connect UI to language models: speech-to-text, text-to-speech
- Connect app to Home Front Command API to trigger operation with delay upon siren
- Add language models to translate responses for users into Hebrew

### Expanding UI Capabilities for Future Accessibility

- Add language models to translate user responses into Arabic and Russian
- Demonstrate functioning without network on user device
- Add animated avatar interface for a more natural user connection
- If avatar tech exists - integrate sign language (varies by country)

## Impact

- Potential influence on various populations
- First Aid
- Long-term
- Economic stability
- Global model
